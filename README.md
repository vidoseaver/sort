# Insert Sort

### Ruby
  I went ahead and threw the sort into a class for ease of testing. In order to run the tests you need to have ruby and the
  testing framework RSpec installed on your machine. From the root of the directory run 
  
  ```
   rspec test/sorter.rb
  ```
  
### Javascript
  The javascript is being tested with the mocha and chai npm libraries. You'll want to have both of those installed on your machine.
  You can do this with:
  ```
  npm install mocha
  npm install chai
  ```
  Once those are installed you can run:
  
  ```
  mocha test/sorter_spec.js
  ```
  To see the tests.
